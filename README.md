# Create-Image-Classifier
This application trained a deep learning model on a dataset of images using Python PyTorch. It used to train an
image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. It loaded, pre-processed the image dataset, trained the
image classifier and predicted image content.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

1- Loaded and preprocessed the image dataset

2- Trained the image classifier on your dataset

3- Used the trained classifier to predict image content
